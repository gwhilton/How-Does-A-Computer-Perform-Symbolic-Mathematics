# How-Does-A-Computer-Perform-Symbolic-Mathematics
Symbolic algebra system able to perform multivariate simplification, evaluation and differentiation.

Completed alongside several peers who are credited in the the original and complete repository https://github.com/HanchongZ/M2R-AO3.

This repository contains the PDF of our research, completed system and an example of how it works.

We build a hierarchical class system, defining numbers and binary operators. From which, we were able to construct rules for simplification, evaluation and derivatives which the algebra system follows. Quite generally, we used directed acyclic graphs for these processes as opposed to trees which are less computationally efficient.
